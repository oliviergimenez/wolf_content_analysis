# Analysis of the Bottlenose dolphin social network  

Contains R code to perform various analyses of the social structure of Bottlenose dolphin in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea. 
I basically relied on the vignettes and papers associated with the packages I used for these analyses, check them out. 
Unfortunately, I cannot share the data yet, you'll have to wait for the publication. Hope this is helpful somehow, anyway.

These analyses were done for the [GDEGeM project](http://www.gdegem.org/). 
If you're interested results on abundance for this project, check out [my talk](http://www.slideshare.net/OlivierGIMENEZ1/a-network-for-bottlenose-dolphin-photoid-monitoring-along-the-french-mediterranean-coast) at the [International Workshop on Bottlenose dolphin conservation and monitoring in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea](http://www.gdegem.org/international-workshop). 
A tutorial on estimating abundance using open capture-recapture models is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/abundance_estimation).
