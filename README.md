# Wolf in newspapers: Content analysis of French articles

This repo contains R code to perform content analyses of local and national French newspapers (namely, Nice Matin and Le Monde) on wolf. These analyses are from a paper we pubished some time ago entitled [Content analysis of newspaper coverage of wolf recolonization in France using structural topic modeling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320717309989) (PDF [here](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/pubs/Chandelieretal2018BC.pdf)).

We used a non-supervised approach (the topics are statistically determined, not chosen a priori) known as `structural topic modeling`: see [Westgate et al. (2015)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12605/abstract) for an introduction and [Roberts et al. (2015)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stm/vignettes/stmVignette.pdf) for an implementation in R.

~~Unfortunately, I cannot share the data yet, you'll have to wait for the publication. Hope this is helpful somehow, anyway.~~
