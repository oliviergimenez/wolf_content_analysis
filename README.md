# Wolf in newspapers: Content analysis of French articles

Contains R code (with French comments I'm afraid) to perform content analyses of local and national French newspapers (namely, Nice Matin and Le Monde) on wolf. Unfortunately, I cannot share the data yet, you'll have to wait for the publication. Hope this is helpful somehow, anyway.

We used a non-supervised approach (the topics are statistically determined, not chosen a priori) known as `structural topic modeling`: see [Westgate et al. (2015)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12605/abstract) for an introduction and [Roberts et al. (2015)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stm/vignettes/stmVignette.pdf) for an implementation in R.
